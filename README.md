## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform spotinst provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 1.0` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by [generating the provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

- [CDK for Terraform](https://cdk.tf)
- [Terraform spotinst provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spotinst/spotinst/1.164.0)
- [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.
